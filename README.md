# üìö Nginx API Gateway
Nginx API Gateway, built in [nginx](https://nginx.com/). It's main purpose is for routing, logging and protecting private routes aswell rate limiting. It is a entry point for client application.

## üìã Prerequisites
[nginx](https://nginx.com/)

Download nginx, if you are linux user (ubuntu). You can type following command in your terminal 

```
apt-get upgrade && apt-get install nginx -y
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Features
- Access Control
  - Session Managment
  - Rate Limiting
- Request routing
- Access & Error logs
- Client friendly error responses

## ‚úçÔ∏è Examples

### Session managment for protected routes
With nginx, we can do session check with internal route /auth/required.
Your /auth/required endpoint is provided by your web server, or you can use [Auth Nodejs Server](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/auth)
In nginx, it is a internal location that acts as a subrequest when accessing some private resource.
As it acts as subrequest, it will pass to resource server if your auth web server returns 2xx http status, and return 4xx http status code if session is not valid.
I do recommend that you use 403 http code (forbidden), as it is already defined in errors.conf and will return JSON client friendly error.

We would need to define [auth_request](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html) in specific location.


```
location /some/private/route/ {
  auth_request /auth/required
  proxy_pass http://some-protected-resource/
  # ... rest
}
```

### Rate limiting specific location

For rate limiting, we have eight levels. One is most non aggressive, and three is most aggresive. You can define your rate limiting strategy. For more information you can check [nginx rate limiting docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/controlling-access-proxied-http/).
If you want to know what rate limiting levels do, check [limit_req.conf](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/vasaknjiga_gateway/blob/main/limit_req.conf).

Note: Zone is limited to 10mb, and 16.000 ip addresses is 1mb, you can have maximum 160.000 ip addresses in one zone.

So, in your location we would need to add rate limiting. We would need to add limit_req zone=[your-rate-limit-zone], or use already defined zones from one to eight;

```
location /some/location/ {
  limit_req zone=two;
  proxy_pass http://some-location/;
  # ... rest
}
```

### Access and error logs

For debugging purpose, finding malicious requests, DoS and DDoS and monitoring, every web server would like to have some sort of logging. Nginx has access log for OK requests and error log for BAD requests. For more information about logging and it's formatting you can check [nginx logging](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/).

You don't have to create file in /var/log/nginx, nginx will do it for yourself. What you need to is actually define access/error log path and file.

I do use default formatting. You can do your own formatting with regex or compression.

```
location /some/location/ {
  access_log /var/log/nginx/some.location.access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/some.location.error.log;
  proxy_pass http://some-location/;
}
```

### Error responses
In your web app, for some cases you need to repeat some error responses, such as bad inputs if inputs were not provided. So with such case we end up with repetative error responses. With nginx error responses, you can describe what response you want to send with JSON client friendly format.

```
error_page 404 = @404;
location @404 { return 404 '{"success":false, "msg":"not-found"}'; }
```
In your web app, there is no need to return message with response, instead you can return (node.js express example) res.status(400).end(), and nginx will handle your response.
